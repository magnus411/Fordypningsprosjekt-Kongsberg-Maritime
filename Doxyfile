PROJECT_BRIEF         = "This file implements the main entry point and configuration setup for the \
Kongsberg Maritime's sensor data handling system. The system is designed to \
collect and store sensor data with flexible and modular configuration capabilities.\n\
\n\
This system can be configured to handle multiple data handlers, each with their \
own thread group. The system is designed to be easily extensible and configurable \
through JSON configuration files.\n\
\n\
Changes to the code can be made to extend the system's capabilities, such as adding protocols. \
This system has built up a framework for adding new configurations later."
